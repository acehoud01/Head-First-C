This directory contains C programming that showcase the use of pointers in C programming.


Getting started:

To run the programs in this directory, you will need to have a C compiler
installed on your computer. If you do not have one, you can download and install the 
GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).

Once you have a C compiler installed, you can compile and run the programs in this directory
using the following steps:
   
   1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory containing the program you want to run.
   2. Compile the program by running the command 'gcc -o program_name program_name.c', where the program name is the name of program file.
   3. Run the program by running the command './program_name'.


What is a pointer?

A poniter is a variable that that stores teh address of another variable. This allows you to access
the value of the variable indirectly, by referring to its address.


Why use pointers?
    Pointers can be used in variety of purposes, including
    *To pass variables to functions by a reference
    *To create dynamic arrays
    *To implement linked lists
    *To create recursive functions
